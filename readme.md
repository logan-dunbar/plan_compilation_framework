Code that compiles a planner's policy into a model-free value function which eventually outperforms the planner through constrained exploration.

From the paper "[Reducing the Planning Horizon through Reinforcement Learning](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/177884717/dunbar_ecml22.pdf)" appearing in ECML PKDD 2022.
